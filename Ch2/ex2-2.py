# Exercise 2: There is an alternative way of computing the best time to party that does not depend on the granularity of time.
# We choose each celebrity interval in turn, and determine how many other celebrity intervals contain the chosen celebrityâ€™s start time.
# We pick the time to attend the party to be the start time of the celebrity whose start time is contained in the maximum number of other celebrity intervals.
# Code this algorithm and verify that it produces the same answer as the algorithm based on sorting.
